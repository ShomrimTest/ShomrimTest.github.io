<h1>Contact Us</h1>
     <p>TISH is a small, independent development team founded in 2022 with a passion for seamlessly and accessibly coordinating Jewish death and mourning rituals. We're currently based in Austin, TX, but the congregations and minyanim we work with are spread out across the globe. We believe in the importance of human dignity, of demystifying death, and in staying grounded in our traditions while we look towards a changing future.</p>
