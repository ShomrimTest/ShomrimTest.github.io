<h1>TISH: The International Shmirah Hub</h1>
<p>Shmirah is the Jewish tradition of prayerfully or mindfully accompanying the deceased between death and burial. During this momentous transition, the shomer honors the deceased by offering a protective presence, and comforts the soul as it begins its new journey away from the body, its lifelong partner.</p>
<p>Shmirah has the distinction of being among the last acts of kindness you can do for another person, one that no two people can do for each other, and one for which the recipient can never thank the giver.</p>
<p>TISH is intended to be used by small, far-flung, and aging communities that cannot reasonably be expected to provide in-person shmirah for their own deceased.</p>
<h1>Why TISH?</h1>
<p>We have member communities, Chevrah Kadishahs, and volunteers from all over the world. Hence, we begin as a community of strangers, rather than a group of people who largely know each other. The word tish is Yiddish for table, a place where people gather to celebrate together, to mourn together, and to learn Torah together. It is our kavanah, our intention, that TISH will be such a space.</p>
