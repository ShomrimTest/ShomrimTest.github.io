<h1>International Virtual Shomrim</h1>
<p>Shmirah is the Jewish tradition of prayerfully or mindfully accompanying the deceased between death and burial. During this momentous transition, the shomer honors the deceased by offering a protective presence, and comforts the soul as it begins its new journey away from the body, its lifelong partner.
<p>Shmirah has the distinction of being among the last acts of kindness you can do for another person, one that no two people can do for each other, and one for which the recipient can never thank the giver. Finally, respectful care when we can no longer care for ourselves is something that each one of us is bound to need someday.
