  <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
  <h2>What is Shmirah?</h2>
  <p>Shmirah is the Jewish tradition of prayerfully or mindfully accompanying the deceased between death and burial. During this momentous transition, the shomer (one who performs the mitzvah of shmirah â€“ plural shomrim, feminine shomeret) honors the body of the deceased by offering a protective presence, and comforts the soul as it begins its new journey away from the body, its lifelong partner.</p>
  <p>Shmirah has the distinction of being among the last acts of kindness you can do for another person, one that no two people can do for each other, and one for which the recipient can never thank the giver. Finally, respectful care when we can no longer care for ourselves is something that each one of us is bound to need someday.</p>
  <h2>Who can be a shomer?</h2>
  <p>Anyone who is willing and able to pray, read, meditate, sing or play comforting music, or hold good intentions and kind thoughts for a couple of hours can serve as a shomer.</p>
  <p>You might be...</p>
  <ul>
    <li>A night owl looking for something to do at 3:00am</li>
    <li>A homemaker/retiree with flexibility during the daytime</li>
    <li>An introvert who thrives on time alone</li>
    <li>A social butterfly who needs protected time to commit to quiet reflection now and then</li>
    <li>Living with a chronic illness, living with a disability, or you might be able-bodied</li>
    <li>Someone with an erratic, unpredictable schedule</li>
    <li>Able to be 'on call' for a particular shift when it is needed</li>
    <li>A young person wanting to honor those who came before you</li>
    <li>An older person anticipating how you want to be cared for when you can no longer care for yourself</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Whoever you are, you can bless someone with your unique presence, and shmirah invites you to become one of the last people on earth to do an act of chesed, of lovingkindness, for a fellow Jew.</p>
